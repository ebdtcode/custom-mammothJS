In the midst of a global health situation, FAA transitioned to a “new normal” and AJV-P worked tirelessly to shift all employees to a work-at-home model. Our processes transformed quickly to ensure team safety and continued operating success in the short- and long-term. To overcome this unique challenge all of us stayed focused on three priorities:</p><p>First, the safety of all. Second, business continuity is key. Third, to the extent we could, provide a helping hand to the communities around us.</p><p>AJV-P is built on the energy and drive of its people. This year’s Year End Report is all about capturing the dynamic quality that permeates every team. These accomplishments aren’t just nice bullet points - each team’s efforts has deep and lasting impacts on AJV-P, Mission Support Services, and the FAA. On every page of this report are the true inner workings of AJV-P, the constant engines that keep us running. You will see accomplishments intrinsically motivated by doing excellent work and producing something that matters. In short, you see our people.</p><p>Our work is always our best introduction to our customers – the report details the highlights of the past year, but several require particular note:</p><ol><li>Established First Responder Tactical Beyond Visual Line of Sight (TBVLOS) Part 91.113 Waiver Process</li></ol><p>There are instances when first responders require the capability, in a time of extreme emergencies to safeguard human life, to operate their unmanned aircraft beyond visual line of sight to assess the operational environment. These needs range from surveying large structural fires, conducting an aerial search on a large roof area for a law enforcement situation in progress, or flying over a heavily forested area to look for a missing child or incoherent person. In support of public UAS operators acting in an active first responder capacity, AJV-P22 promptly responded to this need and developed a process to approve “First Responder Tactical Beyond Visual Line of Sight” (TBVLOS) waivers to 14 CFR 91.113(b). The process to approve temporary beyond visual line of sight flights ensures that upon a complete and accurate application, as reviewed by AJV, a 14 CFR 91.113(b) waiver is issued to allow temporary UAS TBVLOS within specific conditions and requirements as described in the newly developed process.  </p><ol><li>Sun-setting the Notices to Airmen Publication (NTAP): </li></ol><p>The NTAP successfully ended its tenure as a print publication, in conjunction with the long-anticipated launch of the Domestic Notices and International Notices websites. As part of the Notices to Airmen (NOTAM) modernization effort in which the aeronautical data found in the NTAP was required to be transitioned to a digital format; it was determined that the remaining content from the NTAP after the removal of FDC NOTAMs and Part 95 Revisions should be split into separate websites. AJV-P12 worked for months with the NOTAM Modernization Team and the Office of Communications to plan, prepare, and implement the discontinuation.  This project included transferring NTAP notices to the new websites and performing an experimental beta test, socializing the discontinuation and new websites with users, plus updating other orders that referenced the outdated NTAP.  Nowadays, Graphic Notices and International Notices appear on their respective websites and remain accessible, responsive, and Section 508/WCAG 2.AA compliant.</p><ol><li>Support for the ATO Top 5: Traffic Alerts and Safety Advisories – Revision to FAA Order JO 7110.65 and Issuance of an Air Traffic Procedures Bulletin:  </li></ol><p>A Top 5 safety issue for FY20, AJV-P completed and distributed an exhaustive, highly-academic, and thoroughly-researched ATPB to address the systemic safety issue concerning controller failure to issue timely Safety Alerts and Traffic Advisories. This ATPB augments nearly six years of repeated AJI-2 Recurrent Training deliveries on this topic, and addressed the systemic issue from a procedures tact. A typical ATPB runs no more than two or three pages; the recent ATPB runs to seven pages and is chock full of references to National Transportation Safety Board, Air Traffic Technical Training, safety data from recent Mandatory Occurrence Reports, and collaboratively developed NATCA/FAA safety cards. </p><p>Wow, what incredible accomplishments! We are proud of the fact that we have the power to rise above any situation and deliver the best results no matter the circumstances. Great work has resulted in tangible, beneficial results to our customers. Our people are a force to be reckoned with.</p><h1>OVERVIEW OF AJV-P RESPONSIBILITES</h1><p>The Policy group (AJV-P) formed in 2019 by realigning and integrating the non-international elements of the Air Traffic Procedures directorate (AJV-8) with components of the Airspace Services directorate (AJV-1). AJV-8 and AJV-1 had been cooperating on various initiatives, including unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), and one purpose of their formal assimilation was to help procedural changes flow even more efficiently. <br /><br />In general, AJV-P develops regulatory policy and provides air traffic control (ATC) procedural support to users throughout the NAS. This includes providing guidance on matters involving ATC standards and procedures and creating rules, policies, and standards for the use of navigable airspace. Accomplishing this mission involves collaboration with all stakeholders and customers, internal and external, to create and maintain policy to inform decisions and positions on public matters as well as air traffic procedures.<br /><br />It is important for every Mission Support Services employee to understand the scope of the policy work done in Mission Support. The word “Policy” is quite broad and there are numerous organizations in the ATO, as well as in the FAA responsible for implementing policy based on their respective functional role within the Agency. The scope of the AJV-P policy work is limited to those orders and directives that pertain to air traffic procedures and airspace matters. The umbrella of these parameters also comprises the development of policy to support UAS activities in navigable airspace. </p><p>The AJV-P directorate oversees the ATO’s actions in rulemaking activities; air traffic environmental policy; air traffic procedures development; UAS policy; and policies and standards for airspace structure, design, and allocation. AJV-P collaborates with all stakeholders, internal and external, to create and maintain regulations and policy to inform present and future decisions and positions on public matters.  The directorate serves as the principal support group to Service Areas/Centers for guidance on matters involving ATC standards and procedures. All of these important roles trace back to the fundamental mission statement of the Mission Support Services (AJV) Organization:</p><p><em>“We are the architects and caretakers of the National Airspace System.<br />Our people are the bridge between ideas, the operation, and the future of the NAS.”</em></p><h1><a id="_Toc528323112"></a>BUSINESS PLAN GOALS and Key Accomplishments</h1><p><a id="_Toc528323113"></a>AJV-P, in cooperation with various partner organizations, completed a commendable 100% of its FY 2020 business plan goals. Several accomplishments were achieved: </p><p> </p><ul><li>In addition to the completion of HTML coding for three major publications in 2019, AJV-P12 successfully completed and posted to the Air Traffic Publications website an additional two publications in FY20.</li><li>In support of the Very High Frequency Omni-directional Range (VOR) Minimum Operational Network (MON) program office’s goal to remove 30% of the current VORs from the contiguous United States by 2025, AJV-P21 exceeded their goal to discontinue 23 VORs for FY20 and initiated 42 of 42 airspace dockets recommended by the Service Center OSGs.</li><li>The AJV-P2 group completed 31,731 manual authorizations, out of a total 31,762 Part 107 Airspace Authorizations, within the 90-day timeframe mandated by Congress. The goal was to process 95% within 90 days - the target was exceeded each month, at a rate of 99.9%. </li><li>The FAA developed a Strategic Community Engagement (CE) Framework to organize all current and future CE strategic planning activities, identify gaps in existing guidance and practices, and address our needs in a comprehensive manner. AJV-P12 collaborated with other lines of business, staff offices and stakeholders to address a wide range of concerns including aircraft noise. The group created the “Scenario-Based Community Engagement” document and posted the signed version on May 27, 2020.</li></ul><h1>AJV-P Completed Actions</h1><p>AJV-P processes a variety of correspondence types, serving as a reliable source of information, feedback, and expertise while responding to a large number of Email Questions/Clarification Requests and External Correspondence Reviews (ECRs). That said, the plurality of controls processed were Document Change Proposals (DCPs) to cyclical orders. </p><p>There were two DCP publication cycles completed within FY20.  The first was effective January 30th, 2020, and second was effective July 16th, 2020.  In January 2020, AJV-P published 101 DCPs comprising a record-tying 250 paragraph changes.  In July 2020, following a rapid transition to max telework conditions, AJV-P published 51 DCPs spanning 151 paragraph changes. The July cycle returned to the downward trend in changes published per cycle, in alignment with a request by overwhelmed field facilities. One errata was issued for the July 16, 2020 publication cycle, but otherwise the pandemic-necessitated transition to maximum telework only minimally disrupted the processing of changes. See further metrics on the following page (note that the number of DCPs published does not necessarily match the number of DCP controls processed during the FY).</p><table><tr><td colspan="2" rowspan="2"><p><strong>AJV-P Processed Controls for FY 2020</strong></p></td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Control Type</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Count</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Advisory Circular (AC)</p></td><td><p>2</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>ATSAP - AIR</p></td><td><p>3</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>ATSAP - CAP</p></td><td><p>2</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Congressional</p></td><td><p>4</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>DCP</p></td><td><p>160</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Editorial Correction</p></td><td><p>31</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Email Question or Clarification Request</p></td><td><p>129</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>External Correspondence Review (ECR)</p></td><td><p>65</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>FOIA</p></td><td><p>16</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>ICAO - ATMOPS Review</p></td><td><p>7</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Interpretation</p></td><td><p>8</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Letter</p></td><td><p>7</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Letters of Authorization</p></td><td><p>8</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Memo</p></td><td><p>14</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>MOU/MOA</p></td><td><p>1</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Notice</p></td><td><p>7</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Order</p></td><td><p>15</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Other</p></td><td><p>40</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Paper, Briefing, Report,  Presentation</p></td><td><p>6</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Request for Technical Assistance (TA)</p></td><td><p>6</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Notices of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRMS)</p></td><td><p>42</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Final Rules</p></td><td><p>62</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Special Use Airspace (SUA) Actions</p></td><td><p>16</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Safety Finding With Hazards</p></td><td><p>5</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Waiver</p></td><td><p>18</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>UAS 91.113 Waiver</p></td><td><p>17</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Grand Total</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>691</strong></p></td></tr></table><h2>Interpretations</h2><p>AJV-P continues striving toward a goal of processing all Interpretation requests within 60 days.  In FY2019, only 1/5 of Interpretations were processed in under 60 days, while in FY2020 1/3 were processed within the goal window. Additionally, the average processing duration decreased significantly from 398 days in FY2019 to 95 days in FY2020, with processing times affected by the government shutdown in FY2019 and the pandemic in the second half of FY2020. An important goal of FY21 is to increase the percentage of Interpretations processed within 60 days, as well as to continue the downward trend in processing duration.</p><h2>Notices</h2><p>Notices serve a valuable purpose in delivering essential information to the field that cannot wait for the next publication effective date.  However, issuing too many notices reduces their effectiveness by flooding the field with cumbersome documentation, which can hamper comprehension in the fast-paced air traffic environment. Therefore, it is greatly preferred that NAS changes are published via the six-month publication cycle whenever possible, with notices only as a last resort.  <br /><br />In total, 26 notices were published as effective in FY20, including 6 GENOTs. Many of the GENOTs addressed issues directly related to the pandemic and were processed with urgent efficiency, and are an excellent example of when notices are most beneficial. In general, the previous seven fiscal years has continued the zig-zag downward trend in notices published, encompassing a high of 45 in FY14 and a dramatic low of 8 in FY19, which encompassed the longest government shutdown in American history.  In FY20, the jump back up to 26 notices is consistent with recent years, but efforts should be doubled to see that number decrease again for FY21. AJV-P will continue to pursue a balance between the need to inform the field of safety-critical changes before publication effective dates, and the need to avoid overwhelming the field with so many notices that efficiency is lost and truly time-critical changes lose their impact.</p><h1>AJV-p COMMUNITY OUTREACH ACTIVITY</h1><p><a id="_Toc528323114"></a>The Policy directorate not only takes great pride in its work, but also in helping those in the community who need it most. Five years ago, the organization reached out Turner Elementary School located in Southeast Washington, DC. The school was in need of coats for their students, as many did not have proper winter clothing. AJV-P has donated over 150 coats to the school. FY20, the Policy organization, along with other organizations, successfully surpassing our goal of helping 40 students!</p><p>In addition, AJV-P also holds a popular holiday party; while everyone has a lot of fun, it is not lost that one of the main reasons we come together is to raise money for the Combined Federal Campaign. Last year’s holiday party was able to raise over $4,300 dollars for various charities. The extraordinary results of the outreach program work by the organization speaks to the kindness and compassion of the people within it.</p><h1>AJV-p EMPLOYEE RECOGNITION</h1><p><a id="_Toc528323115"></a>In general, AJV-P’s employee engagement team consists of six “engaged” team members and the Senior Advisor as the executive lead. The team meets monthly to discuss activities/events for the directorate. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the team sponsored the following notable events:</p><ul><li>Art at Home Challenge</li><li>Show off your Pet</li><li>Spirit Week</li><li>Suggestion Box</li><li>Focus Groups</li><li>FedView Survey Video</li></ul><p>Over the past several years, employee recognition of the AJV-P organization has soared. Specifically, the directorate’s Employee Engagement (EE) lead received an ATO Employee Engagement Team Captain award recognizing their hard work supporting the organization throughout the year. The accolades continued when the EE Captain won the Graduate School USA W. Edwards Deming Award in 2108, which recognizes outstanding FAA Employee Engagement work across all federal, state, and local governments. </p><p>These awards turned out to be the start of the “gift that keeps on giving.” Specifically, in 2019, the organization’s team lead, along with five other ATO captains, received an invitation to participate in a live view cast at the Watergate. At this event, held in conjunction with the Graduate School USA and Government Executive, they relayed the Agency’s commitment to employee engagement and discussed activities within the organization. On another occasion, the directorate’s EE lead, again with five of the ATO Employee Engagement Captains, partook in a panel discussion for the Federal Workforce Development Conference sponsored by the Graduate School. Held at the Holiday Inn near FAA HQ, the team had the opportunity to speak with other government agencies in attendance about employee engagement activities at the FAA and answer questions. To conclude FY20, the EE lead attended another Graduate School event. This time, the luncheon/Graduate School USA W. Edwards Deming awards ceremony was held at the Willard Intercontinental Hotel in downtown Washington, DC. The team had the honor of presenting the sizable bronze eagle award trophies, each of which weighed over 50 pounds.</p><p>The organization truly takes great pride in recognizing individuals for their efforts. For example, back in FY18, the Employee Engagement Team created two new awards programs: the “High Five” Award and the “Crushed It” Award. The “High Five” Award goes to an individual who uniquely contributes to the overall success of the organization.  Each quarter the organization presents a “High Five” award to someone who makes a difference - a person who readily offers a laugh, inspiration, or words of encouragement. However, the “Crushed It” Award recognizes not only AJV-P internal employees, but also employees from other organizations who deserve recognition for something outstanding or exemplary support efforts for AJV. This “ad hoc” award is presented to the recipient in front of their peers and management team. Throughout FY20, our organization presented 20 “Crushed It” Awards, nine Director Certificate of Excellence awards, and four of the quarterly “High-Five” awards. AJV-P appreciates the efforts of our employees as well as employees within other lines of business, and feel they deserve to be lauded. To be sure, extraordinary work performance is not exclusively found within the confines of the AJV-P directorate. </p><h1>AJV-P REALIGnMENT</h1><p>The latest and greatest iteration of Mission Support Services, in the form of the Policy (AJV-P) directorate, formed via the integration of AJV-8 and AJV-1 at the conclusion of FY19.  The following organization chart illustrates the group’s overarching structure for much of FY20:</p><p><em>Policy AJV-P Org Chart</em></p><p><strong>Karen Chiodini (A)</strong></p><p>Policy Director</p><p><strong>Natking Estevez</strong></p><p>Policy Support</p><p>AJV-P1 Group Manager</p><p><strong>Scott Rosenbloom (A)</strong></p><p>Rules &amp; Regulations</p><p>AJVP2 Group Manager</p><p><strong>John Combs</strong></p><p>Standards &amp; Procedures</p><p>AJV-P3 Group Manager</p><p><strong>Michael Beckles</strong></p><p>UAS Policy Team</p><p>AJV-P22 Manager</p><p><strong>Mark Gauch (A)</strong></p><p>Airspace Rules &amp; Regulations Team</p><p>AJV-P21 Manager</p><p><strong>Kelvin Baker (A)</strong></p><p>ATC Procedures (Terminal) Team</p><p>AJV-P31 Manager</p><p><strong>Kerryaine Yarber (A)</strong></p><p>Publications &amp; Administration Team </p><p>AJV-P12 Manager</p><p><strong>Vacant</strong></p><p>Policy Assurance Team</p><p>AJV-P13 Manager</p><p><strong>Mohammad Kushan (A) </strong></p><p>ATC Procedures (EnRoute) Team</p><p>AJV-P32 Manager</p><h1><a id="_Toc528323116"></a>AJV-P By the Numbers </h1><h2><a id="_Toc528323117"></a>Publications &amp; Administration (AJV-P12)</h2><p>The Publications &amp; Administration team realized the completion of 162 controls, including 60 DCPs; 45 email questions/clarification requests; 24 External Correspondence Reviews (ECRs); 17 editorial corrections; five Orders; two Memos, one letter, and eight “Other” control types.</p><p>A major highlight of the year, AJV-P12 produced the latest edition of the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) manual, effective October 1, 2020. This update to the SOP contained significant, widespread changes, including clarifying the steps for a NAS change with SMS documentation, particularly during Final Coordination. In addition, a new Appendix provided information on the Interagency Group on International Aviation (IGIA), and the processing of International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) differences, while other updates significantly expanded the guidelines for Records Management and the responsibilities of the Directives Management Officer. Finally, new procedures effectively transitioned to an electronic coordination process, while additional measures accounted for the spectrum of correspondence types processed by AJV-P2.</p><p>AJV-P12 continued the HTML conversion of all AJV-P orders and publications, and accomplished the long-term goal of transitioning the Notices to Airmen Publication (NTAP) from print version to the Domestic and International Notices websites.</p><p>On another note, AJV-P12 provided training for the whole AJV-P directorate throughout the year. During FY20, two DCP formatting classes were held, providing key insight for both AJV-P personnel and outside organizations. Four of the ever-important SMS refresher trainings were offered throughout the fiscal year, and 19 onboard training sessions convened, in order to train 26 individuals upon joining the organization. Finally, refresher trainings focused on signature authority and introducing new documents, like the Internal Management Review (IMR) form, kept the organization high functioning and informed during the maximum telework transition. </p><p><a id="_Toc528323118"></a></p><h2>Policy Assurance Team (AJV-P13)</h2><p>Looking back on a highly productive year, the Policy Assurance Team, AJV-P13, concluded 13 controls, including five email question/clarification requests, four External Correspondence Reviews (ECR), and one Advisory Circular (AC), editorial correction, and FOIA request.</p><p>One of the major accomplishments to date, AJV-P13 completely reorganized and updated FAA Advisory Circular 70/7460-1, Obstruction Marking and Lighting. This was a substantial undertaking and AJV-P13 coordinated with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), lighting manufacturing community, FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center, and the Obstruction Evaluation Group (OEG) Office. The document was complete in September; however, at the request of the FCC, the document will be released on November 16. As a courtesy for continued positive relationships, the FAA notified the lighting manufacturing community of the November release date. </p><p>The AJV-P13 group provided responses to 13 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. To do this, they trained five OEG employees to process FOIA requests and continued to support the new employees when needed. Additionally, the group reviewed responsive records, letters and worksheets for comment for three studies, as well as informed the reassignment of eight FOIAs. Moreover, the team developed information, authored the OEG FOIA Desk Guide, and assisted with writing and reviewing the final documents for release.</p><p>AJV-P13 also researched and prepared responses to public inquiries to the OEG, participated in several workgroups for future changes and improvements to the obstruction evaluation process, and processed Policy and Administration controls.</p><h2>Airspace Rules &amp; Regulations (AJV-P21)</h2><p>The Airspace Rules &amp; Regulations AJV-P21 team has collectively been extremely busy this past fiscal year with the ever-changing and ever-evolving work in airspace designations, environmental assessments, and notices of proposed rulemaking. Due to COVID-19, the team also held its first virtual conference via Zoom. Overall, the AJV-P21 team successfully completed their objectives and goals for FY20.</p><p>To begin, AJV-P21 hosted 167 attendees at the Airspace &amp; Environmental Conference. The purpose of this conference was to restart annual meetings of the HQ Airspace Rules and Regulations Team and the Service Center Operations Support Groups for discussing a variety of topics: airspace and ATS route (Part 71), Special Use Airspace (Part 73 and non-rulemaking), and supporting environmental actions. Primarily, the focus remains policy guidance, processes, and challenges, using a forum that enabled all to participate in the discussions and contribute to decisions of how we collectively resolve challenges.</p><p>Additionally, AJV-P21 managed and completed numerous environmental and rulemaking actions, including:</p><p><strong>Environmental </strong></p><ul><li>Finalized Categorical Exclusion document for the North Shore Helicopter route rule.</li><li>Published policy on National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) applicability to Air Traffic Control Assigned Airspace (ATCAA).</li><li>Confirmed NEPA adoption documents for seven Special Use Airspace DoD actions (including three TMOA renewals/re-activations).</li><li>Completed Las Vegas Metroplex Environmental Assessment (EA).</li><li>Finalized Draft Florida Metroplex EA for public review and comments.</li></ul><p>Completed development and review of Missile Defense Agency’s (MDA) Environmental Assessment, and finalized FAA’s Adoption Environmental Assessment for Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) Testing at Clear, Alaska. </p><p><strong>Partnership for Safety Plan (PSP) </strong></p><ul><li>PSP with Google Loon signed, and AJV-P22 conducted the kick-off for the first quarterly PMR.</li></ul><p><strong>Rulemaking</strong></p><ul><li>Published:<ul><li>42 Notices of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRMS) </li><li>62  Final Rules </li><li>16 Special Use Airspace (SUA) Actions</li></ul></li><li>Scoped 2209 Rule, achieved milestone 1 (MST1) removal of 99.7s and re-baseline of schedule approved by Rule-Making Committee (RMC).</li><li>Published commercial space LOA templates in the JO 7400.2 and JO 7210.3.</li><li>The Modernization of Special Airworthiness Certificate (MOSAIC) team successfully met MST1 on August 27, 2020.</li><li>Remote Identification of Unmanned Aircraft rulemaking processed on time, despite a major shift in policy that removed network and only broadcast. In addition, an astounding 40,000 comments were addressed. Policy was developed for community-based organizations and educational institutions to apply for FAA-recognized identification areas (FRIA) where UAS operators do not need to comply with RID. This allows continuous aviation exploration by hobbyist and educational institutions via programs like STEM and Jr ROTC.</li><li>Supported supersonic rule, which will modernize the procedure for requesting a special flight authorization to operate supersonic over the United States.</li><li>Supported “Operations Over People” rule, which will allow Part 107 operators to fly UAS over people and at night without having to receive a waiver</li></ul><p>An outstanding effort by an outstanding team! Go AJV-P21!<a id="_Toc528323122"></a></p><h2>UAS Policy (AJV-P22)</h2><p>Throughout FY20, the UAS Policy team vigorously monitored, adjusted, and adapted to the remarkable pace of UAS technology advancement and increased user requests. All this happened while the team examined process improvement strategies to allow consistent and efficient processing of all UAS-related demands. Accomplishments from the past year include: </p><p><strong>UAS</strong></p><ul><li>Established First Responder Tactical Beyond Visual Line of Sight (TBVLOS) 91.113 waiver process.</li><li>Established long-term/multiday part 107 airspace authorization policy supporting operational requests.  </li><li>Published FAA Order JO 7200.23B, updated policy for UAS waivers and authorizations related to Part 107, Part 91, and Section 44809.</li><li>Developed checklist to standardize ATC Facility procedural reviews to support On-Airport UAS Operations.</li><li>Published policy and process for Part 91 UAS operations to use UAS Facility Maps.  </li></ul><p><strong>Partnership for Safety Plan (PSP) </strong></p><ul><li>Facilitated the American Tower Partnership for Safety Plan; the first operations in controlled airspace occurred in February 2020</li></ul><p>It is truly amazing how fast things change in the UAS arena, but the AJV-P22 team is “locked and loaded” to handle everything - from small recreational drones to the establishment of large passenger-carrying unmanned vehicles operating from Vertiports. The future is here and now, and we are ready. </p><h2>ATC Procedures - Terminal (AJV-P31)</h2><p>The Terminal Standards and Procedures team fully transitioned to a telework posture in March 2020 and maintained or exceeded outcome expectations throughout FY20.</p><p>To this end, AJV-P31 processed a total of 165 controls, comprised as follows: 38 email questions/clarification requests, 33 DCPs; 28 External Correspondence Reviews; 18 Waivers, eight editorial corrections; and eight Letters of Authorization.
